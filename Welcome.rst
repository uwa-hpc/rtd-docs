The University of Western Australia 
High Performance Computing Services

==================

The University of Western Australia acknowledges that its campus is 
situated on Noongar land, and that Noongar people remain the 
spiritual and cultural custodians of their land, and continue to 
practise their values, languages, beliefs and knowledge.

Kaya!  Is the Noongar word for "hello" and is the ideal way to introduce 
this new HPC service at UWA.
